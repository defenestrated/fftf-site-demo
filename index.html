                  <p>In early January, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/secretary-zinke-announces-plan-unleashing-americas-offshore-oil-and-gas-potential">the government's plan</a> to open up "nearly the entire U.S. Continental Shelf" for oil and gas drilling. We've known for a while that <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/experts/franz-matzner/offshore-drilling-dirty-dangerous-and-unnecessary">this is a terrible idea</a>, and yet the Trump administration continues to ignore reality in order to appease irresponsible oil companies.</p>
                  <p>It's clear from the language of the DOI's proposal that this plan's goal is not to responsibly develop new energy sources: one of the plan's authors wants America to be <span class="quote">"moving from aspiring for energy independence to attaining energy dominance"</span> (Vincent DeVito, Counselor for Energy Policy at the Dept. of the Interior).</p>

              <p>According to <a href="https://www.boem.gov/uploadedFiles/BOEM/About_BOEM/BOEM_Regions/Alaska_Region/Leasing_and_Plans/Leasing/Lease_Sales/Sale_193/Lease_Sale_193_DraftSSEIS_vol1.pdf">a 2014 study</a> in Alaska by none other than the Dept. of Interior, there's a <strong>75% chance of "one or more large spills occuring"</strong> in the 74-year period between exploration and final production. But even if that (somehow) doesn't happen, the drilling operation alone <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/offshore.pdf">destabilizes entire ecosystems and releases toxic metals like lead, mercury, and cadmium into our seafood supply.</a></p>
              <p>...But spills do happen, and when they do, they're some of the biggest environmental disasters on record. We still don't fully understand the extent of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/04/26/six-years-later-were-still-learning-how-badly-the-bp-spill-damaged-the-environment/?utm_term=.fecaefc86c71">the damage that the BP oil spill on the Deepwater Horizon caused in 2010.</a></p>
