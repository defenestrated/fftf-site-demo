# site demo for Fight For The Future

## sam galison  //  2018

### development notes:

- I really only had time to put together the HTML and CSS, so the primary site files are [index.html](index.html) and [style.css](assets/css/style.css)
- Right now, the form does nothing except link out to [an Action Network petition](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/stop-offshore-drilling?p_name=&email=). Ideally, I’d use their api to just add directly to the petition without navigating away (but you need a “partner” account with them to get an api key). There's also [this change.org petition that has 120k signatures](https://www.change.org/p/stop-offshore-oil-and-gas-drilling), so it feels like there should be a way to link the two.
- I’d like to include more video; interviews with scientists, video of the deepwater spill, and generally make the site a little more of a complete experience. I think the images there now hint at this idea.
- It’s not optimized particularly well for speed or mobile screens (though it should be tolerable) – I’d fix that given more time.
